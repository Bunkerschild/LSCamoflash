## ðŸ”§ Changes & New Features

### ðŸ›  System Services
- Now, LSCamoflash supports autopatch, which automatically detects anyka version and patches it for RTSP support.
- The hack is **non-invasive** â€“ the firmware remains unchanged.
- **Manufacturer update routine disabled**, preventing cloud-based removal of the hack.
- RTSP only mode can be enabled for direct streaming, without cloud.
- **TUYA cloud can be completely blocked** via offline mode.
- Otherwise, the TUYA functionality remains fully operational.

### ðŸ“¡ Web Server & Remote Access
- Web server available on **port 8080** with username 'admin' and password 'admin' by default.
- Telnet service runs on **port 24** with username 'root' and password 'LSCamoflash' by default.
- FTP server provides **direct SD card access** with username 'root' and password 'LSCamoflash' by default.
- **chpasswd** as replacement for passwd to make passwordchanges permanent, otherwise it gets overwritten after reboot.

### ðŸ”„ Update & SD Card Persistence
- The **hack is not removed** even after formatting via the TUYA app (just wait **one minute** post-formatting).
- The SD card **can be formatted without affecting modifications**.

---

## ðŸ”œ Planned Features for Future Versions
- **Building own kernel** to add swap and z-ram support and also ext2 modules.
- **Optimized monitoring script** for quicker system checks.
- **Anti-Tampering** support to detect foreign SD cards.
- **Additional MQTT and ONVIF enhancements** for improved integration.

## ðŸ“¥ Download & Installation

LSCamoflash requires an SD card with two partitions to function properly. The software has been updated to detect manipulations on the SD card, making it necessary to move the hack files to a separate partition (`mmcblk0p2`).

### Partition Requirements:
- **Partition 1 (`mmcblk0p1`)**: At least **14GB**, formatted as **FAT32**.
  - Stores video recordings as well as `hostapd` and `_ht_ap_mode.conf`.
- **Partition 2 (`mmcblk0p2`)**: At least **1GB**, formatted as **FAT32**.
  - Stores the hack files.

The `SDCARD` folder in this repository contains:
- `mmcblk0p1/` - Contents for the first partition.
- `mmcblk0p2/` - Contents for the second partition.

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)
To simplify partitioning and file copying, installation scripts are provided for Windows and Linux:

- **Windows**: Run `install.ps1` in powershell as Administrator.
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
  .\install.ps1
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Default -Scope Process -Force
  ```
- **Linux**: Run `install.sh` with root privileges:
  ```bash
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

These scripts will automatically handle partitioning and copying the files to the SD card.

## Manual SD Card Partitioning
If the scripts cannot be used, the SD card can be partitioned manually.

### **Windows (Using Diskpart)**

1. **Insert the SD card into the computer**.
2. **Open the command prompt as Administrator** (`Win + R`, type `cmd`, then press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`).
3. **Start Diskpart**:
   ```
   diskpart
   ```
4. **List available disks**:
   ```
   list disk
   ```
5. **Select the SD card** (replace `X` with the correct disk number):
   ```
   select disk X
   ```
6. **Clean the SD card**:
   ```
   clean
   ```
7. **Create the first partition (`mmcblk0p1`)**:
   ```
   create partition primary
   shrink desired=1024
   format fs=fat32 quick
   assign letter=E
   ```
8. **Create the second partition (`mmcblk0p2`)**:
   ```
   create partition primary
   format fs=fat32 quick
   assign letter=F
   ```
9. **Exit Diskpart**:
   ```
   exit
   ```
10. **Copy files**:
    - Copy the contents of `SDCARD/mmcblk0p1/` to the **first partition** (`mmcblk0p1`).
    - Copy the contents of `SDCARD/mmcblk0p2/` to the **second partition** (`mmcblk0p2`).

### **Linux (Manual Method)**

1. **Identify the SD card**:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   mmcblk0      14.9G
   â”œâ”€mmcblk0p1  14G  
   â””â”€mmcblk0p2  1G  
   ```
2. **Unmount the SD card (if mounted)**:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
   sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
   ```
3. **Start `fdisk` to partition the SD card**:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
   ```
   - Press `d` to delete existing partitions.
   - Press `n` to create a new partition:
     - Select `p` for primary partition.
     - Partition **1**, size **+14G**.
     - Press `t`, then enter `b` for FAT32.
   - Press `n` again to create the second partition:
     - Partition **2**, size **+1G** (or more).
     - Press `t`, select partition **2**, enter `b` for FAT32.
   - Press `w` to save changes and exit `fdisk`.
4. **Format the partitions**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/mmcblk0p1
   sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/mmcblk0p2
   ```
5. **Copy files**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/mmcblk0p1
   sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/mmcblk0p2
   
   sudo cp -r SDCARD/mmcblk0p1/* /mnt/mmcblk0p1/
   sudo cp -r SDCARD/mmcblk0p2/* /mnt/mmcblk0p2/
   
   sudo umount /mnt/mmcblk0p1
   sudo umount /mnt/mmcblk0p2
   ```

---

The **recommended method** is the **automatic installation with `install.ps1` (Windows) or `install.sh` (Linux)**, as it avoids errors and simplifies the process.
